      question: "How long does a typical repair take?",
      shortAnswer: "Most repairs are completed within 24-48 hours.",
      fullAnswer: "Most repairs are completed within 24-48 hours. However, the exact time can vary depending on the type of device, the complexity of the repair, and the availability of parts. Some simple repairs, like screen replacements for common smartphone models, can often be done on the same day. For more complex repairs or if we need to order special parts, it might take up longer. We always strive to complete repairs as quickly as possible without compromising on quality."
